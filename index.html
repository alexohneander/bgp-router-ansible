            <h3 id="our-network"><strong>Our Network</strong></h3>
            <p>/dev/null operates the network AS201033, which hosts our Steam gaming platform. Our network consists of
                globally-distributed game servers and content download servers. We operate several dozen
                points-of-presence (&ldquo;PoPs&rdquo;) around the world, and we are present many internet exchanges
                (IXPs) and private interconnection facilities, all of which are <a
                    href="https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/32590">listed on our PeeringDB page</a>.</p>
            <p>AS201033 delivers two main types of traffic: <a
                    href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/">high-volume CDN traffic</a>
                (&ldquo;content&rdquo;), namely video game downloads, and relatively lower-volume but latency-sensitive
                &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; traffic, including gameplay data, user sessions, etc. As a rough guideline,
                over 95% of our delivered traffic is &ldquo;content&rdquo;, while less than 5% is
                &ldquo;interactive&rdquo;. Similarly, our traffic balance is roughly 95% outbound from AS201033, 5%
                inbound to AS201033.</p>
            <h3 id="independent-pops"><strong>Independent PoPs</strong></h3>
            <p>Each Valve PoP has its own set of servers. A given PoP may host content servers, game servers, or both.
            </p>
            <p>Each Valve PoP only advertises IP prefixes unique to that location. The IP prefixes advertised to peers
                (of any kind) from a given PoP are completely local to that PoP. We do not use BGP Anycast. We provide
                <a href="http://AS201033.net/geofeed.csv">an RFC 8805 Geofeed CSV,</a> mapping our advertised IP prefixes
                to our geographic PoPs. Steam clients will probe real-time conditions to find the best entry point into
                our network.</p>
            <p>Each Valve PoP routes traffic independently. Prefixes learned from peers in a given PoP stay local to
                that PoP, and do not influence traffic sourced from servers in other PoPs.</p>
            <p>Users are directed to the best Valve PoP. Requests from users for AS201033 are directed to a particular
                geographic PoP by a variety of techniques, depending on the location of the user, the type of traffic
                being requested, the client application making the request, and the capacity of each PoP at that moment.
                By default, clients attempt to direct requests to the most-appropriate PoP, to minimize latency and to
                maximize performance for the user, as capacity allows.</p>
            <p>If you believe there is an issue or inaccuracy with the mapping of user requests to specific Valve PoPs,
                you can contact us at <a href="mailto:peering@valvesoftware.com">peering@valvesoftware.com</a>. Include
                the source IP prefix of the user(s), their geographic information, and your AS information to
                investigate.</p>
            <h3 id="peering-policy"><strong>Peering Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>Valve maintains an Open peering policy.</p>
            <p>All of our peering information is available at <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/32590">our
                    PeeringDB page</a>.</p>
            <p>To peer with Valve, you must meet these requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Publicly routable ASN and IPv4/IPv6 address space</li>
                <li>Presence at one or more IXPs or private peering interconnection facilities listed for <a
                        href="https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/32590">Valve in PeeringDB</a></li>
                <li>Maintain an accurate and up-to-date PeeringDB entry
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have automated workflows that pull information from PeeringDB, so your entry must be
                            populated</li>
                        <li>At a minimum, your entry should include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contact information</li>
                                <li>Public ASN</li>

                                <li>Accurate number of IP prefixes you will announce</li>
                                <li>Peering facility information</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="ixp-peering"><strong>IXP Peering</strong></h3>
            <p>We are present at many Internet Exchanges and peer with the route servers at all IXPs we are present at.
                We are always keen to support more IXPs, especially not-for-profit IXPs. If there is an IXP that is
                reachable from one of our locations and we&rsquo;re not there, get in touch with us at <a
                    href="mailto:peering@valvesoftware.com">peering@valvesoftware.com</a>. We are also happy to support
                people setting up new peering ecosystems, especially in under-served markets.</p>
            <p>If you are peered with the route servers at a shared IXP, then you should receive all of our local routes
                (and vice versa), and likely do not need to peer with us directly. In most cases, peering with the IXP
                route servers is all you need to do. If necessary, we support bi-lateral peering sessions at IXP
                locations with networks that we exchange a reasonable amount of traffic with (&gt;100Mb/s), depending on
                the IXP location. We advertise the same prefixes to all peers, whether via bi-lateral peering or via
                route server, so bi-lateral sessions will not change your latency to us.</p>
            <p>If you meet these requirements, and wish to peer with Valve, configure sessions on your routers using our
                <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/32590">PeeringDB information</a>. Then email us at <a
                    href="mailto:peering@valvesoftware.com">peering@valvesoftware.com</a>. Tell us your ASN, and the
                location(s) where you would like to peer. At many locations, we have two or more connections to an IXP.
                Please peer with <em>all</em> of our connections to that IXP.</p>
            <h3 id="pni-peering"><strong>PNI Peering</strong></h3>
            <p>We support settlement-free peering via private network interconnects (PNIs) at the locations listed in
                our PeeringDB page, or reachable by a standard cross-connect (XC) from one of those locations.</p>
            <p>PNIs are available for peers with whom we exchange at least 10Gb/s of traffic. Networks with lower
                amounts of traffic should join the same IXPs as us.</p>
            <p>We only support 100G and 400G ports for PNIs; no new 10G PNIs will be provisioned. We prefer 100G-LR1
                optics for 100G connections. This is much more efficient on modern high capacity routers. We can support
                100G-LR4 optics in some but not all locations. We support 400G-LR4 for 400G connections.</p>
            <p>We typically request an additional (or larger) PNI when traffic levels reach 50% utilization. We split
                costs by taking turns on which side orders each cross-connect and provides IPs, and which side provides
                the LOA.</p>
            <p>If you meet these requirements, and wish to set up a PNI, email us at <a
                    href="mailto:peering@valvesoftware.com">peering@valvesoftware.com</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="peering-technical-details"><strong>Peering Technical Details</strong></h3>
            <p>There is no service level agreement (SLA) for our peering connections, nor any guarantee that traffic
                will be always exchanged via a peering connection. We may perform network maintenances without
                notification.</p>
            <p>We configure all new PNIs as LAGs using LACP, even single connections, to allow for easy expansion and
                troubleshooting. If we have two individual connections at a location, each will be configured as its own
                single-member LAG with LACP.</p>
            <p>We do not support MD5 for new BGP sessions, including PNI sessions. We do not support MED.</p>
            <p>For egress traffic, each Valve PoP prefers routes learned via PNI first, via IXP second, and via transit
                last. For routes not learned via peering (i.e. only via transit), AS path length may or may not be
                considered, depending on the traffic type and network capacity at the PoP.</p>
            <h3 id="steamcaches"><strong>SteamCaches</strong></h3>
            <p>Valve operates a <a href="/steamcache/">SteamCache program</a>, where ISPs or IXPs can host one or more
                SteamCaches. SteamCaches are servers which act as caches for Steam content traffic and are deployed
                within an ISP or IXP network. SteamCaches can reduce traffic between an ISP and Valve by up to 90%, and
                can increase download performance for Steam users.</p>
            <p>For more information, check out <a href="/steamcache/">our SteamCache page</a>.</p>
            <p>Note: we are not able to support caches in all countries.</p>
            <h3 id="faq"><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Do I need to peer with Valve?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Probably not. If you are connected to one of the same IXPs as us, and you are peering with the route
                server, you will see our prefixes, and we will route to you via that IXP. If you don&rsquo;t peer with
                the route servers, or you wish to announce more specific prefixes, then bi-lateral peering might be a
                good idea. Bi-lateral peering on its own will not change latency if you already peer with the route
                server.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>But you only announce a few prefixes via the route server - will you announce more prefixes via a
                    bi-lateral session?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>No. We announce the same prefixes via bi-lateral sessions as we do via the route server. These are the
                local prefixes for that PoP.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Why don&rsquo;t you announce all prefixes via peering?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our network design is to only announce the local prefixes at each site, and then clients will probe
                real-time conditions to find the best entry point to our network. We do not need to announce all
                prefixes at all sites. It will not improve client latency.</p>

                <p>Why are you not at &ldquo;my favourite IXP&rdquo;?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We are always keen to support more IXPs, especially not-for-profit IXPs. We join most IXPs that are
                reachable from the locations we are present at. If there is an IXP that is reachable from one of our
                locations and we&rsquo;re not there, get in touch with us. Maybe we can join. We are also happy to
                support people setting up new peering ecosystems, especially in under-served markets.</p>

                <p>Why does some traffic come from other locations? Why doesn&rsquo;t it all come via our peering and/or
                    PNI?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our network will attempt to deliver content from the closest PoP to your users. Occasionally one PoP may
                be overloaded, and content will be delivered from other nearby PoPs. There are also times when our CDN
                rules may need updating. If you think you are getting too much content from the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;
                location, get in touch with us at <a
                    href="mailto:peering@valvesoftware.com">peering@valvesoftware.com</a> and we can check.</p>
            <p>Note: there will always be a small amount of traffic from other locations as clients probe the best path
                to our relays. In some network topologies, your clients may find a better path to our network via
                transit connections rather than via peering.</p>
            <p>If there is congestion on our PNIs or peering links, we will de-prioritise content traffic, pushing that
                towards transit paths. We will keep gaming traffic on PNIs and peering.</p>

                <p>I really want a 10G PNI in Ashburn!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We are sorry, but we are no longer able to add new 10G PNIs. Given the relative cost of transit and
                cross-connects, along with the costs of 10G access on 100G/400G-dense routing platforms, it is not
                practical to connect at 10G. If you don&rsquo;t have enough traffic to justify a 100G PNI, join one of
                the IXPs we are at. You will also benefit from getting access to other networks at those IXPs.</p>

                <p>Please fix the latency between Lima and Virginia</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Unfortunately the laws of physics apply to us. We can&rsquo;t change the distance between Lima and
                Virginia. This is why we have game servers distributed around the world, to get them closer to users.
                Our network of <a

                also helps with finding the best possible combination of entry point to our network and game servers.

                <p>I want to run my own game server</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For some games, you can run your own &ldquo;community&rdquo; dedicated game servers. We can not run
                official game servers in every possible location. This would fragment the player base, reduce player
                diversity and affect matchmaking.</p>
